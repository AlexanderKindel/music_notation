There is a default space height for staves. Each staff has a scale, which indicates how the staff's space height compares to the default height. A staff scale is a name, for example, "cue," with an associated decimal value. By default, "cue" has the value 0.75, which means the space height of a cue staff is 0.75 times that of a default staff. You can edit the decimal value associated with a staff scale. Doing so adjusts the height of all staves in the score that have that scale accordingly. You can create new staff scales in order to support a larger number of staff sizes in a score. You can also delete existing staff scales. If you try to delete a scale that one or more staves in the score use, you will be prompted to choose a different scale to assign to those staves.

If you hover the mouse cursor over a staff, a gray entry cursor will appear at the nearest available entry cursor position to the left of the mouse cursor. Clicking will make the entry cursor active. The ticks protruding rightward from the cursor span an interval of a diatonic seventh, and indicate which octave a newly-entered note will take. The up and down arrow keys adjust the octave of the cursor, and the right and left arrow keys move the cursor to the next or previous symbol on the staff.

The Add Clef dialog specifies only the shape of the clef. Once entered, you can select a clef by clicking it, and move it up and down by step using the up and down arrow keys. Thus you enter both alto clefs and tenor clefs by selecting a C clef in the dialog, but position the latter by shifting them two steps upward.

To enter a note, set the desired duration using the "selected duration" and "augmentation dots" controls at the top of the screen, then type the letter name of the desired pitch. The space bar enters rests of equivalent duration. Clicking a note selects it. You can then use the up and down arrow keys to adjust its pitch. If you hold down the shift key, they adjust the accidental. Otherwise, they adjust the pitch stepwise.
